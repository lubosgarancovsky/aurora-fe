# Aurora

Aurora is my personal full-stack web application designed to allow users to create and manage their projects efficiently by creating tasks and subtasks, reassigning them between team members, and moving them between different states.

## Front end

Front end of the application is written with Next.js and Tailwind. For queries, I used TanStack Query ( React Query ) library.
JWT authentication is done using the NextAuth and its credentials provider.

Application includes board with draggable cards similar to Jira board and an option to create a team and invite members to help collaborate on the project.
